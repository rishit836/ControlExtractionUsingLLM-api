Flow control restrictions include blocking external\ntraffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information\nfrom being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from\nthe internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based\non data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an\nagreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information\nbetween systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy\npolicies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy\npolicies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy\nenforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific\narchitectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies.

Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does\nnot enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect\nthe ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote\naccess controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public\naccess. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing\nremote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization.

External monitoring\nincludes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal\nmonitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations\nmonitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects\nsuch as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives\nguide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved\nthrough a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems,\nmalicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and\nnetwork monitoring software.\nDepending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices\nmay impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations\nacross a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput\nmanagement is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an\nestablished organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices\ninclude selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical\napplications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated\nwith controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational\nmonitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of\ntransactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP\nproxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and\nincident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those\nprograms. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system\nmonitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-\n13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-\n43b).

A reference validation mechanism is always invoked, tamper-proof,\nand small enough to be subject to analysis and tests, the completeness of which can be assured\n(i.e., verifiable). Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as\ndata structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and\npassive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with individuals, devices, or\nprocesses acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are associated\nwith data structures, such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables, files, and inter-\nprocess pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies that restrict access to objects\nbased on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The system enforces\nthe access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamper-proof\nproperty of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from compromising the\nfunctioning of the reference validation mechanism. The always invoked property prevents\nadversaries from bypassing the mechanism and violating the security policy. The smallness\nproperty helps to ensure completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect\nany weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the\nsecurity policy.\nRelated Controls: AC-3, AC-16, SA-8, SA-17, SC-3, SC-11, SC-39, SI-13.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: None."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-25\", \"control_title\": \"Reference Monitor for Policy Enforcement\", \"control_desc\": \"Implement a reference monitor for [Assignment: organization-defined access control policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be subject to analysis and testing, the completeness of which can be assured.

Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external systems].\nDiscussion: External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems,\nand for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required\ncontrols or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned\nsystems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in\ncommercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;\nsystems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by,\noperated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems\nalso include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and\nsystems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the\noption to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of\nexternal systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned\nor prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships\nthat have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be\nsuch that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may\nnot be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing\ninformation exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations\nor components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational\npersonnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and\nover which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding\nsystem access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be\nuniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.\nTherefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors\nthan on state, local, or tribal governments.\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope\nof AC-20.

Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and\ndevelopment of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can\nbe obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring,\nand network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An\neffective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities\n(e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,\nphysical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function],\noperations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of\nsuspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain\nincidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational\nsystems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally\nidentifiable information is considered a breach. A breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the\nloss of control, unauthorized acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence where a person\nother than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable\ninformation or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such information for other\nthan authorized purposes.\nRelated Controls: AC-19, AU-6, AU-7, CM-6, CP-2, CP-3, CP-4, IR-2, IR-3, IR-5, IR-6, IR-8, PE-6, PL-\n2, PM-12, SA-8, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) INCIDENT HANDLING | AUTOMATED INCIDENT HANDLING PROCESSES\nSupport the incident handling process using [Assignment: organization-defined automated\nmechanisms].\nDiscussion: Automated mechanisms that support incident handling processes include online\nincident management systems and tools that support the collection of live response data,\nfull network packet capture, and forensic analysis.\nRelated Controls: None.\n(2) INCIDENT HANDLING | DYNAMIC RECONFIGURATION"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"IR-4\", \"control_title\": \"Incident Handling Capability and Coordination\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications [Assignment:\norganization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined\nprocess] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and\nreported;\nb. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among\ntools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:\n1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;\n2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and\n3. Measuring vulnerability impact;\nc.

Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control\nassessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate\nsimilar vulnerabilities in other systems; and\nf. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the\nvulnerabilities to be scanned.\nDiscussion: Security categorization of information and systems guides the frequency and\ncomprehensiveness of vulnerability monitoring (including scans). Organizations determine the\nrequired vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of\nvulnerabilities—such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors),\nnetworked printers, scanners, and copiers—are not overlooked. The capability to readily update\nvulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new\nscanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by\nemployed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps\nto ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as\npossible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional\napproaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three\napproaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a\nvariety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary\nanalyzers.\nVulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports,\nprotocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow\ncontrol mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly.

A reference validation mechanism is always invoked, tamper-proof,\nand small enough to be subject to analysis and tests, the completeness of which can be assured\n(i.e., verifiable). Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as\ndata structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and\npassive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are associated with individuals, devices, or\nprocesses acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are associated\nwith data structures, such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables, files, and inter-\nprocess pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies that restrict access to objects\nbased on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The system enforces\nthe access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamper-proof\nproperty of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from compromising the\nfunctioning of the reference validation mechanism. The always invoked property prevents\nadversaries from bypassing the mechanism and violating the security policy.

Types of remote access\ninclude dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks\n(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections.

Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does\nnot enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect\nthe ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote\naccess controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public\naccess. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing\nremote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization.

Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-\ndefined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental\nchanges; and\nc. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and\nmodification.\nDiscussion: The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well\nas the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an\norganization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized\nproduction, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software\nand hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply\nchain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an\norganization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted\nundertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships\nand communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management\n(SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response\nactions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance\nagainst plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy\nimplementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or\nincorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing,\nimplementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems\nacross the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are\ntailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans\nprovide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is\nfit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans\nhelp organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions\nbased on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk\nmanagement plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization,\nacceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently\nevaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating\nthe plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and\nassociated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address\nrequirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system\ncomponents and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented\nas part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).\nRelated Controls: CA-2, CP-4, IR-4, MA-2, MA-6, PE-16, PL-2, PM-9, PM-30, RA-3, RA-7, SA-8, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN | ESTABLISH SCRM TEAM"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SR-2\", \"control_title\": \"Supply Chain Risk Management Plan Development\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

The required skills include\ngeneral knowledge of risk management concepts and approaches as well as comprehensive\nknowledge of and experience with the hardware, software, and firmware system components\nimplemented.\nOrganizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those systems operate\nas part of initial and ongoing authorizations, continuous monitoring, FISMA annual assessments,\nsystem design and development, systems security engineering, privacy engineering, and the\nsystem development life cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet information\nsecurity and privacy requirements, identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the system design and\ndevelopment process, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part\nof authorization processes, and comply with vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations\nconduct assessments on the implemented controls as documented in security and privacy plans.\nAssessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of\nsystems engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for controls can be\nassessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design reviews conducted. If a design\nto implement controls and subsequent implementation in accordance with the design are\nassessed during development, the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing\npreviously completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes.\nOrganizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment plan for the\nsystem or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment plan clearly delineates the roles\nand responsibilities for control assessment. If multiple organizations participate in assessing a\nsystem, a coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.\nOrganizations can use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and\nsystem monitoring, to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the system"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"CA-2\", \"control_title\": \"Control Assessments for System Verification\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-\ndefined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental\nchanges; and\nc. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and\nmodification.\nDiscussion: The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well\nas the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an\norganization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized\nproduction, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software\nand hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply\nchain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an\norganization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted\nundertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships\nand communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management\n(SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response\nactions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance\nagainst plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy\nimplementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or\nincorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing,\nimplementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems\nacross the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are\ntailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans\nprovide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is\nfit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans\nhelp organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions\nbased on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk\nmanagement plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization,\nacceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently\nevaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating\nthe plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and\nassociated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address\nrequirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system\ncomponents and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented\nas part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).\nRelated Controls: CA-2, CP-4, IR-4, MA-2, MA-6, PE-16, PL-2, PM-9, PM-30, RA-3, RA-7, SA-8, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN | ESTABLISH SCRM TEAM"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SR-2\", \"control_title\": \"Supply Chain Risk Management Plan Development\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Description of the system development environment and environment in which the system\nis intended to operate;\nh. Allocation of responsibility or identification of parties responsible for information security,\nprivacy, and supply chain risk management; and\ni. Acceptance criteria.\nDiscussion: Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-\nlevel security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements include\nsecurity and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated\nwith such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,\nresistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements\ninclude development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from\ndevelopment and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required\nfunctionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [SP 800-160-1]\ndescribes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate\nfor achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting\nthe security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in\norder to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities.\nControls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection\nand implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in\nthe form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived\nrequirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of\nimplementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\nSecurity and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development\nlife cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and\noperation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security\ncategorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend\non the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements\ncan include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and\nservices. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in\nthe same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.\nRelated Controls: CM-6, CM-8, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-21, SR-3,\nSR-5.\nControl Enhancements:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SA-4\", \"control_title\": \"Acquisition Process Requirements and Assurance\", \"control_desc\": \"Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, using [Selection (one or more): standardized contract language; [Assignment: organization-defined contract language]] in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or system service: a.

Personnel are trained to look for\nindications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected email, receiving an\nemail containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an unfamiliar sender\nthat appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how\nto respond to suspicious email or web communications. For this process to work effectively,\npersonnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications.\nTraining personnel on how to recognize anomalous behaviors in systems can provide\norganizations with early warning for the presence of malicious code.

Data storage objects include\ndatabase records and database fields. Sensitive information can be extracted from data mining\noperations. When information is personally identifiable information, it may lead to unanticipated\nrevelations about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing data mining\nactivities, organizations determine whether such activities are authorized. Organizations may be\nsubject to applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, or policies that address data\nmining requirements. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy\nand legal counsel regarding such requirements.\nData mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number and frequency of\ndatabase queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of databases,\nlimiting types of responses provided to database queries, applying differential privacy techniques\nor homomorphic encryption, and notifying personnel when atypical database queries or accesses\noccur.

Enforce a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon\nattempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and\nb. Automatically [Selection (one or more): lock the account or node for an [Assignment:\norganization-defined time period]; lock the account or node until released by an\nadministrator; delay next logon prompt per [Assignment: organization-defined delay\nalgorithm]; notify system administrator; take other [Assignment: organization-defined\naction]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.\nDiscussion: The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent action when the\nmaximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a\nlocal or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts\ninitiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,\norganization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ\ndifferent algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those\ncomponents. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating\nsystem and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the\nnumber of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to\nanswer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode\nwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying\nuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)\naddress. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in\nsupport of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to\nhelp prevent brute force attacks.

Organizational users include employees or\nindividuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g.,\ncontractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to\nall accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the\nauthorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes\nexecute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of\nindividuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\nOrganizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user\nidentities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to\norganizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\naccess to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is\nobtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to\norganizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained\nthrough network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access\nthat involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area\nnetworks and wide area networks.\nThe use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-\ncontrolled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal\nnetworks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing\nthe network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are\ndescribed in IA-8.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, AU-1, AU-6, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8, MA-4, MA-\n5, PE-2, PL-4, SA-4, SA-8.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS\nImplement multi-factor authentication for access to privileged accounts.\nDiscussion: Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to\nachieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you\nknow (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical\nauthenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric).\nMulti-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware\nauthenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such\nas the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the Department of\nDefense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to authenticating users at the system\nlevel (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application\nlevel, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e.,\nlocal, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options\nappropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as\nadditional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.\nRelated Controls: AC-5, AC-6.\n(2) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"IA-2\", \"control_title\": \"Identification and Authentication of Organizational Users\", \"control_desc\": \"Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.

Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network\nprotocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the\norigination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can\nfilter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being\ndirectly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks.

External systems include personally owned\nsystems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in\ncommercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;\nsystems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by,\noperated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems\nalso include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and\nsystems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the\noption to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of\nexternal systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned\nor prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships\nthat have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be\nsuch that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may\nnot be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing\ninformation exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations\nor components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational\npersonnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and\nover which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding\nsystem access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be\nuniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.\nTherefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors\nthan on state, local, or tribal governments.\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope\nof AC-20.

Incorporate lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response\nprocedures, training, and testing, and implement the resulting changes accordingly; and\nd. Ensure the rigor, intensity, scope, and results of incident handling activities are comparable\nand predictable across the organization.\nDiscussion: Organizations recognize that incident response capabilities are dependent on the\ncapabilities of organizational systems and the mission and business processes being supported by\nthose systems. Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and\ndevelopment of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can\nbe obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring,\nand network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An\neffective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities\n(e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,\nphysical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function],\noperations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of\nsuspicious email communications that can contain malicious code.

For federal\ninformation security and privacy policies, the term requirement is generally used to refer to\ninformation security and privacy obligations imposed on organizations. For example, [OMB A-\n130] imposes information security and privacy requirements with which federal agencies must\ncomply when managing information resources. The term requirement can also be used in a\nbroader sense to refer to an expression of stakeholder protection needs for a particular system\nor organization. Stakeholder protection needs and the corresponding security and privacy\nrequirements may be derived from many sources (e.g., laws, executive orders, directives,\nregulations, policies, standards, mission and business needs, or risk assessments). The term\nrequirement, as used in this guideline, includes both legal and policy requirements, as well as an\nexpression of the broader set of stakeholder protection needs that may be derived from other\nsources. All of these requirements, when applied to a system, help determine the necessary\ncharacteristics of the system—encompassing security, privacy, and assurance.24\nOrganizations may divide security and privacy requirements into more granular categories,\ndepending on where the requirements are employed in the system development life cycle\n(SDLC) and for what purpose. Organizations may use the term capability requirement to describe\na capability that the system or organization must provide to satisfy a stakeholder protection\nneed. In addition, organizations may refer to system requirements that pertain to particular\nhardware, software, and firmware components of a system as specification requirements—that\nis, capabilities that implement all or part of a control and that may be assessed (i.e., as part of\nthe verification, validation, testing, and evaluation processes). Finally, organizations may use the\nterm statement of work requirements to refer to actions that must be performed operationally\nor during system development.\n24 The system characteristics that impact security and privacy vary and include the system type and function in terms\nof its primary purpose; the system make-up in terms of its technology, mechanical, physical, and human elements;\nthe modes and states within which the system delivers its functions and services; the criticality or importance of the\nsystem and its constituent functions and services; the sensitivity of the data or information processed, stored, or\ntransmitted; the consequence of loss, failure, or degradation relative to the ability of the system to execute correctly\nand to provide for its own protection (i.e., self-protection); and monetary or other value [SP 800-160-1]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}], "has_control": false}

This includes ensuring that Tier 1 (prime) contractors have implemented\nprocesses to facilitate the “flow down” of supply chain risk management controls to sub-tier\ncontractors. The controls subject to flow down are identified in SR-3b.\nRelated Controls: SR-5, SR-8.\nReferences: [FASC18], [41 CFR 201], [EO 13873], [ISO 20243], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-161], [IR\n7622].\nSR-4 PROVENANCE\nControl: Document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance of the following systems, system\ncomponents, and associated data: [Assignment: organization-defined systems, system\ncomponents, and associated data].\nDiscussion: Every system and system component has a point of origin and may be changed\nthroughout its existence. Provenance is the chronology of the origin, development, ownership,\nlocation, and changes to a system or system component and associated data. It may also include\npersonnel and processes used to interact with or make modifications to the system, component,\nor associated data. Organizations consider developing procedures (see SR-1) for allocating\nresponsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance for systems and\nsystem components; transferring provenance documentation and responsibility between\norganizations; and preventing and monitoring for unauthorized changes to the provenance\nrecords.

Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit\nfunction: [Assignment: organization-defined event types that the system is capable of\nlogging];\nb. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-\nrelated information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;\nc. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-\ndefined event types (subset of the event types defined in AU-2a.) along with the frequency of\n(or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type];\nd. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate\nto support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and\ne. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined\nfrequency].\nDiscussion: An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require\nlogging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the\nprivacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event\ntypes include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or\nprivacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action\nchanges, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types\nthat require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of\nthe controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are\noperational and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging\nrequires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For\nexample, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access\nsuccessful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due\nto the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to\nbe logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help\nensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization.\nOrganizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals\nthat may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the\npotential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging\nevent is based on patterns or time of usage.\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in\nother controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1),\nCM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8),\nSI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records\ncan be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the\nnetwork. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring\nand auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types,\norganizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in\ndistributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented\narchitectures.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-\n11, AU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-\n7, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AU-2\", \"control_title\": \"Event Logging and Rationale for Selection\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Separation of duties includes\ndividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles,\nconducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security\npersonnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions.\nBecause separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations\nconsider the entirety of systems and system components when developing policy on separation\nof duties.

Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research and\ndevelopment, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and\nmaintenance, and disposal of the following systems, system components or system services:\n[Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services];\nb. Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-\ndefined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental\nchanges; and\nc. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and\nmodification.\nDiscussion: The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well\nas the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an\norganization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized\nproduction, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software\nand hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply\nchain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an\norganization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted\nundertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships\nand communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management\n(SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response\nactions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance\nagainst plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy\nimplementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or\nincorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing,\nimplementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems\nacross the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are\ntailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans\nprovide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is\nfit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans\nhelp organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions\nbased on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk\nmanagement plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization,\nacceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently\nevaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating\nthe plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and\nassociated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address\nrequirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system\ncomponents and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented\nas part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).\nRelated Controls: CA-2, CP-4, IR-4, MA-2, MA-6, PE-16, PL-2, PM-9, PM-30, RA-3, RA-7, SA-8, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN | ESTABLISH SCRM TEAM"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SR-2\", \"control_title\": \"Supply Chain Risk Management Plan Development\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

For example,\nmaintaining the identity of individuals who request specific services across organizational\nboundaries may often be difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance and\nprivacy ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational audit logging simply\ncaptures the identity of individuals who issue requests at the initial system, and subsequent\nsystems record that the requests originated from authorized individuals. Organizations consider\nincluding processes for coordinating audit information requirements and protection of audit\ninformation in information exchange agreements.\nRelated Controls: AU-3, AU-6, AU-7, CA-3, PT-7.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDIT LOGGING | IDENTITY PRESERVATION\nPreserve the identity of individuals in cross-organizational audit trails.\nDiscussion: Identity preservation is applied when there is a need to be able to trace actions\nthat are performed across organizational boundaries to a specific individual.\nRelated Controls: IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8.\n(2) CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDIT LOGGING | SHARING OF AUDIT INFORMATION\nProvide cross-organizational audit information to [Assignment: organization-defined\norganizations] based on [Assignment: organization-defined cross-organizational sharing\nagreements].\nDiscussion: Due to the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization\nsharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the auditing being\nperformed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide sufficient\ninformation to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information\nresources by individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only individuals’ home\norganizations have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring\nthe sharing of audit information among organizations.\nRelated Controls: IR-4, SI-4.\n(3) CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING | DISASSOCIABILITY\nImplement [Assignment: organization-defined measures] to disassociate individuals from\naudit information transmitted across organizational boundaries.\nDiscussion: Preserving identities in audit trails could have privacy ramifications, such as\nenabling the tracking and profiling of individuals, but may not be operationally necessary.\nThese risks could be further amplified when transmitting information across organizational\nboundaries. Implementing privacy-enhancing cryptographic techniques can disassociate\nindividuals from audit information and reduce privacy risk while maintaining accountability."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}], "has_control": false}

Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external systems].\nDiscussion: External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems,\nand for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required\ncontrols or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned\nsystems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in\ncommercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;\nsystems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by,\noperated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems\nalso include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and\nsystems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the\noption to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of\nexternal systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned\nor prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships\nthat have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be\nsuch that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may\nnot be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing\ninformation exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations\nor components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational\npersonnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and\nover which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding\nsystem access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be\nuniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.\nTherefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors\nthan on state, local, or tribal governments.\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope\nof AC-20.

Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit\nfunction: [Assignment: organization-defined event types that the system is capable of\nlogging];\nb. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-\nrelated information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;\nc. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-\ndefined event types (subset of the event types defined in AU-2a.) along with the frequency of\n(or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type];\nd. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate\nto support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and\ne. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined\nfrequency].\nDiscussion: An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require\nlogging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the\nprivacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event\ntypes include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or\nprivacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action\nchanges, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types\nthat require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of\nthe controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are\noperational and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging\nrequires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For\nexample, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access\nsuccessful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due\nto the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to\nbe logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help\nensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization.\nOrganizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals\nthat may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the\npotential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging\nevent is based on patterns or time of usage.\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in\nother controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1),\nCM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8),\nSI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records\ncan be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the\nnetwork. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring\nand auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types,\norganizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in\ndistributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented\narchitectures.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-\n11, AU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-\n7, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AU-2\", \"control_title\": \"Event Logging and Rationale for Selection\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts\ninitiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,\norganization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ\ndifferent algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those\ncomponents. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating\nsystem and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the\nnumber of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to\nanswer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode\nwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying\nuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)\naddress. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in\nsupport of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to\nhelp prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to\nrespond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is\nexceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not\npermitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-9, AU-2, AU-6, IA-5.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT LOCK\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-7.]\n(2) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | PURGE OR WIPE MOBILE DEVICE\nPurge or wipe information from [Assignment: organization-defined mobile devices] based\non [Assignment: organization-defined purging or wiping requirements and techniques]\nafter [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive, unsuccessful device logon\nattempts.\nDiscussion: A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it\ncan be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection;\npossesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained\npower source.

Separation of duties includes\ndividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles,\nconducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security\npersonnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions.\nBecause separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations\nconsider the entirety of systems and system components when developing policy on separation\nof duties.

Incorporate lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response\nprocedures, training, and testing, and implement the resulting changes accordingly; and\nd. Ensure the rigor, intensity, scope, and results of incident handling activities are comparable\nand predictable across the organization.\nDiscussion: Organizations recognize that incident response capabilities are dependent on the\ncapabilities of organizational systems and the mission and business processes being supported by\nthose systems. Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and\ndevelopment of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can\nbe obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring,\nand network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An\neffective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities\n(e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,\nphysical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function],\noperations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of\nsuspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain\nincidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational\nsystems or system components.

External monitoring\nincludes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal\nmonitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations\nmonitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects\nsuch as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives\nguide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved\nthrough a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems,\nmalicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and\nnetwork monitoring software.\nDepending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices\nmay impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations\nacross a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput\nmanagement is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an\nestablished organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices\ninclude selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical\napplications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated\nwith controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational\nmonitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of\ntransactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP\nproxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and\nincident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those\nprograms. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system\nmonitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-\n13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-\n43b).

Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations\nwhere identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather\nto situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred.

The risk management strategy is an important\nfactor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security\nand privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate\non the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program\npolicies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the\nneed for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part\nof the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the\ncomplex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy\nprograms, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe\nhow the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is\nthe object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans\nor in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control\npolicy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or\nchanges in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\nSimply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls: IA-1, PM-9, PM-24, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100], [IR 7874]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-1\", \"control_title\": \"Access Control Policy and Procedures Requirements\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Flow control restrictions include blocking external\ntraffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information\nfrom being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from\nthe internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based\non data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an\nagreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information\nbetween systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy\npolicies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy\npolicies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy\nenforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific\narchitectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes\nprohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only),\nverifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy\ndomain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-4\", \"control_title\": \"Information Flow Enforcement Based on Policies\", \"control_desc\": \"Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].

Passive entities, also known as objects, are associated\nwith data structures, such as records, buffers, communications ports, tables, files, and inter-\nprocess pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies that restrict access to objects\nbased on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The system enforces\nthe access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy.

Types of remote access\ninclude dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks\n(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections.

Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does\nnot enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect\nthe ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote\naccess controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public\naccess. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing\nremote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization.

Security properties of\nsystems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection of system\ncomponents or changes to those components. The interconnections or changes—including\nupgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware—may adversely affect\npreviously implemented controls. Ongoing assessment during development allows for additional\ntypes of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential\nflaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as manual code\nreview, security architecture review, and penetration testing, as well as and static analysis,\ndynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches.\nDevelopers can use the analysis approaches, along with security instrumentation and fuzzing, in a\nvariety of tools and in source code reviews. The security and privacy assessment plans include\nthe specific activities that developers plan to carry out, including the types of analyses, testing,\nevaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components; the degree of rigor to be applied;\nthe frequency of the ongoing testing and evaluation; and the types of artifacts produced during\nthose processes. The depth of testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail\nassociated with the assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the\nscope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process.

Acceptance criteria.\nDiscussion: Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-\nlevel security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements include\nsecurity and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated\nwith such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,\nresistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements\ninclude development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from\ndevelopment and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required\nfunctionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [SP 800-160-1]\ndescribes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate\nfor achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting\nthe security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in\norder to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities.\nControls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection\nand implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in\nthe form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived\nrequirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of\nimplementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\nSecurity and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development\nlife cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and\noperation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security\ncategorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend\non the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements\ncan include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and\nservices. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in\nthe same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.\nRelated Controls: CM-6, CM-8, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-21, SR-3,\nSR-5.\nControl Enhancements:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SA-4\", \"control_title\": \"Acquisition Process Requirements and Assurance\", \"control_desc\": \"Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, using [Selection (one or more): standardized contract language; [Assignment: organization-defined contract language]] in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or system service: a.

Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit\nfunction: [Assignment: organization-defined event types that the system is capable of\nlogging];\nb. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-\nrelated information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;\nc.

Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate\nto support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and\ne. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined\nfrequency].\nDiscussion: An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require\nlogging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the\nprivacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event\ntypes include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or\nprivacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action\nchanges, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types\nthat require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of\nthe controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are\noperational and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging\nrequires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For\nexample, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access\nsuccessful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due\nto the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to\nbe logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help\nensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization.\nOrganizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals\nthat may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the\npotential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging\nevent is based on patterns or time of usage.\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in\nother controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1),\nCM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8),\nSI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records\ncan be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the\nnetwork. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring\nand auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types,\norganizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in\ndistributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented\narchitectures.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-\n11, AU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-\n7, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AU-2\", \"control_title\": \"Event Logging and Rationale for Selection\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

This can result in\nexposing information resources to unintended environments and uses that can significantly\nincrease threat exposure. In doing so, the systems are more vulnerable to compromise, which\ncan ultimately impact the services and functions for which they were intended.

Allocation of responsibility or identification of parties responsible for information security,\nprivacy, and supply chain risk management; and\ni. Acceptance criteria.\nDiscussion: Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-\nlevel security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements include\nsecurity and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated\nwith such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,\nresistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements\ninclude development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from\ndevelopment and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required\nfunctionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [SP 800-160-1]\ndescribes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate\nfor achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting\nthe security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in\norder to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities.\nControls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection\nand implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in\nthe form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived\nrequirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of\nimplementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\nSecurity and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development\nlife cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and\noperation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security\ncategorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend\non the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements\ncan include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and\nservices. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in\nthe same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.\nRelated Controls: CM-6, CM-8, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-21, SR-3,\nSR-5.\nControl Enhancements:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SA-4\", \"control_title\": \"Acquisition Process Requirements and Assurance\", \"control_desc\": \"Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, using [Selection (one or more): standardized contract language; [Assignment: organization-defined contract language]] in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or system service: a.

It can also help individuals ensure that their data is accurate.\nAccess mechanisms can include request forms and application interfaces.

Flow control restrictions include blocking external\ntraffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information\nfrom being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from\nthe internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based\non data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an\nagreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information\nbetween systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy\npolicies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy\npolicies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy\nenforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific\narchitectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies.

Identifying the control implementation approach can result in significant savings to\norganizations in implementation and assessment costs and a more consistent application of the\ncontrols organization-wide. Typically, the identification of the control implementation approach\nis straightforward. However, the implementation takes significant planning and coordination.\nPlanning for the implementation approach of a control (i.e., common, hybrid, or system-specific)\nis best carried out early in the system development life cycle and coordinated with the entities\nproviding the control [SP 800-37]. Similarly, if a control is to be inheritable, coordination is\nrequired with the inheriting entity to ensure that the control meets its needs. This is especially\nimportant given the nature of control parameters. An inheriting entity cannot assume that\ncontrols are the same and mitigate the appropriate risk to the system just because the control\nidentifiers (e.g., AC-1) are the same. It is essential to examine the control parameters (e.g.,\nassignment or selection operations) when determining if a common control is adequate to\nmitigate system-specific risks.\n2.4 SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS\nThe selection and implementation of security and privacy controls reflect the objectives of\ninformation security and privacy programs and how those programs manage their respective\nrisks. Depending on the circumstances, these objectives and risks can be independent or\noverlapping. Federal information security programs are responsible for protecting information\nand information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or\ndestruction (i.e., unauthorized activity or system behavior) to provide confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability. Those programs are also responsible for managing security risk and for ensuring\ncompliance with applicable security requirements. Federal privacy programs are responsible for\nmanaging risks to individuals associated with the creation, collection, use, processing, storage,\nmaintenance, dissemination, disclosure, or disposal (collectively referred to as “processing”) of\nPII and for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy requirements.28 When a system\nprocesses PII, the information security program and the privacy program have a shared\nresponsibility for managing the security risks for the PII in the system. Due to this overlap in\nresponsibilities, the controls that organizations select to manage these security risks will\ngenerally be the same regardless of their designation as security or privacy controls in control\nbaselines or program or system plans.\nThere also may be circumstances in which the selection and/or implementation of the control or\ncontrol enhancement affects the ability of a program to achieve its objectives and manage its\nrespective risks. The control discussion section may highlight specific security and/or privacy\nconsiderations so that organizations can take these considerations into account as they\ndetermine the most effective method to implement the control. However, these considerations\nare not exhaustive.\nFor example, an organization might select AU-3 (Content of Audit Records) to support\nmonitoring for unauthorized access to an information asset that does not include PII. Since the\n28 Privacy programs may also choose to consider the risks to individuals that may arise from their interactions with\ninformation systems, where the processing of personally identifiable information may be less impactful than the\neffect that the system has on individuals’ behavior or activities. Such effects would constitute risks to individual\nautonomy, and organizations may need to take steps to manage those risks in addition to information security and\nprivacy risks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}], "has_control": false}

External monitoring\nincludes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal\nmonitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations\nmonitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects\nsuch as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives\nguide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved\nthrough a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems,\nmalicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and\nnetwork monitoring software.\nDepending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices\nmay impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations\nacross a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput\nmanagement is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an\nestablished organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices\ninclude selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical\napplications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated\nwith controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational\nmonitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of\ntransactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP\nproxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and\nincident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those\nprograms. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system\nmonitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-\n13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-\n43b).

Contingency planning is considered throughout the\nsystem development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be\ndesigned for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans\nreflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need\nto fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery\nobjectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,\nguidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.\nActions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown,\nfallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for\nwhen systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling\nactivities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in\nthe event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an\nincident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4(5).\nIncident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in\nthe IR (Incident Response) family."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"CP-2\", \"control_title\": \"System Contingency Plan and Recovery Activities\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating\nsystem and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the\nnumber of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to\nanswer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode\nwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying\nuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)\naddress. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in\nsupport of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to\nhelp prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to\nrespond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is\nexceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not\npermitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-9, AU-2, AU-6, IA-5.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT LOCK\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-7.]\n(2) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | PURGE OR WIPE MOBILE DEVICE\nPurge or wipe information from [Assignment: organization-defined mobile devices] based\non [Assignment: organization-defined purging or wiping requirements and techniques]\nafter [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive, unsuccessful device logon\nattempts.\nDiscussion: A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it\ncan be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection;\npossesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained\npower source.
