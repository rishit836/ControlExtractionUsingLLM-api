The risk management strategy is an important\nfactor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security\nand privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate\non the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program\npolicies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the\nneed for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part\nof the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the\ncomplex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy\nprograms, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe\nhow the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is\nthe object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans\nor in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control\npolicy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or\nchanges in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\nSimply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls: IA-1, PM-9, PM-24, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100], [IR 7874]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-1\", \"control_title\": \"Access Control Policy and Procedures Requirements\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Flow control restrictions include blocking external\ntraffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information\nfrom being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from\nthe internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based\non data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an\nagreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information\nbetween systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy\npolicies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy\npolicies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy\nenforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific\narchitectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes\nprohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only),\nverifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy\ndomain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-4\", \"control_title\": \"Information Flow Enforcement Based on Policies\", \"control_desc\": \"Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].

Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts\ninitiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,\norganization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ\ndifferent algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those\ncomponents. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating\nsystem and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the\nnumber of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to\nanswer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode\nwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying\nuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)\naddress. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in\nsupport of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to\nhelp prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to\nrespond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is\nexceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not\npermitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-9, AU-2, AU-6, IA-5.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT LOCK\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-7.]\n(2) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | PURGE OR WIPE MOBILE DEVICE\nPurge or wipe information from [Assignment: organization-defined mobile devices] based\non [Assignment: organization-defined purging or wiping requirements and techniques]\nafter [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive, unsuccessful device logon\nattempts.\nDiscussion: A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it\ncan be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection;\npossesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained\npower source.

Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and\nimplementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and\nb.

Types of remote access\ninclude dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks\n(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted\nVPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such\nconnections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in\naccordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,\nand guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does\nnot enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect\nthe ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote\naccess controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public\naccess. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing\nremote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations\nmay use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote\naccess connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing\naccess restrictions for remote access is addressed via AC-3.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, CA-3, CM-10, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4, PE-\n17, PL-2, PL-4, SC-10, SC-12, SC-13, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) REMOTE ACCESS | MONITORING AND CONTROL\nEmploy automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods.\nDiscussion: Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to\ndetect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the\nconnection activities of remote users on a variety of system components, including servers,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-17\", \"control_title\": \"Remote Access Usage Restrictions and Authorization\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

External systems include personally owned\nsystems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in\ncommercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;\nsystems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by,\noperated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems\nalso include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and\nsystems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the\noption to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of\nexternal systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned\nor prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships\nthat have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be\nsuch that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may\nnot be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing\ninformation exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations\nor components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational\npersonnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and\nover which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding\nsystem access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be\nuniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.\nTherefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors\nthan on state, local, or tribal governments.\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope\nof AC-20.

Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit\nfunction: [Assignment: organization-defined event types that the system is capable of\nlogging];\nb. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-\nrelated information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;\nc. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-\ndefined event types (subset of the event types defined in AU-2a.) along with the frequency of\n(or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type];\nd.

Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined\nfrequency].\nDiscussion: An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require\nlogging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the\nprivacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event\ntypes include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or\nprivacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action\nchanges, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types\nthat require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of\nthe controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are\noperational and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging\nrequires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For\nexample, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access\nsuccessful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due\nto the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to\nbe logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help\nensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization.\nOrganizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals\nthat may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the\npotential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging\nevent is based on patterns or time of usage.\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in\nother controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1),\nCM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8),\nSI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records\ncan be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the\nnetwork. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring\nand auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types,\norganizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in\ndistributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented\narchitectures.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-\n11, AU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-\n7, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AU-2\", \"control_title\": \"Event Logging and Rationale for Selection\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Contingency planning\naddresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes\nwhen systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the\nsystem development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be\ndesigned for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans\nreflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need\nto fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery\nobjectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,\nguidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.\nActions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown,\nfallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for\nwhen systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling\nactivities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in\nthe event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an\nincident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4(5).\nIncident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in\nthe IR (Incident Response) family."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"CP-2\", \"control_title\": \"System Contingency Plan and Recovery Activities\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Organizational users include employees or\nindividuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g.,\ncontractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to\nall accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the\nauthorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes\nexecute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of\nindividuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\nOrganizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user\nidentities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to\norganizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\naccess to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is\nobtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to\norganizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained\nthrough network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access\nthat involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area\nnetworks and wide area networks.\nThe use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-\ncontrolled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal\nnetworks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing\nthe network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are\ndescribed in IA-8.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, AU-1, AU-6, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8, MA-4, MA-\n5, PE-2, PL-4, SA-4, SA-8.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS\nImplement multi-factor authentication for access to privileged accounts.\nDiscussion: Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to\nachieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you\nknow (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical\nauthenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric).\nMulti-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware\nauthenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such\nas the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the Department of\nDefense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to authenticating users at the system\nlevel (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application\nlevel, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e.,\nlocal, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options\nappropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as\nadditional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.\nRelated Controls: AC-5, AC-6.\n(2) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"IA-2\", \"control_title\": \"Identification and Authentication of Organizational Users\", \"control_desc\": \"Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.

Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and\ndevelopment of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can\nbe obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring,\nand network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An\neffective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities\n(e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,\nphysical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function],\noperations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of\nsuspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain\nincidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational\nsystems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally\nidentifiable information is considered a breach.

Acceptance criteria.\nDiscussion: Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-\nlevel security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements include\nsecurity and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated\nwith such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,\nresistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements\ninclude development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from\ndevelopment and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required\nfunctionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [SP 800-160-1]\ndescribes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate\nfor achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting\nthe security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in\norder to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities.\nControls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection\nand implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in\nthe form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived\nrequirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of\nimplementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\nSecurity and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development\nlife cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and\noperation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security\ncategorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend\non the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements\ncan include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and\nservices. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in\nthe same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.\nRelated Controls: CM-6, CM-8, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-21, SR-3,\nSR-5.\nControl Enhancements:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SA-4\", \"control_title\": \"Acquisition Process Requirements and Assurance\", \"control_desc\": \"Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, using [Selection (one or more): standardized contract language; [Assignment: organization-defined contract language]] in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or system service: a.

External monitoring\nincludes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal\nmonitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations\nmonitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects\nsuch as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives\nguide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved\nthrough a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems,\nmalicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and\nnetwork monitoring software.\nDepending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices\nmay impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations\nacross a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput\nmanagement is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an\nestablished organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices\ninclude selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical\napplications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated\nwith controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational\nmonitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of\ntransactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP\nproxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and\nincident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those\nprograms. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system\nmonitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-\n13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-\n43b).

Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-\ndefined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental\nchanges; and\nc. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and\nmodification.\nDiscussion: The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well\nas the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an\norganization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized\nproduction, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software\nand hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply\nchain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an\norganization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted\nundertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships\nand communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management\n(SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response\nactions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance\nagainst plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy\nimplementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or\nincorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing,\nimplementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems\nacross the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are\ntailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans\nprovide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is\nfit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans\nhelp organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions\nbased on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk\nmanagement plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization,\nacceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently\nevaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating\nthe plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and\nassociated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address\nrequirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system\ncomponents and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented\nas part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).\nRelated Controls: CA-2, CP-4, IR-4, MA-2, MA-6, PE-16, PL-2, PM-9, PM-30, RA-3, RA-7, SA-8, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN | ESTABLISH SCRM TEAM"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SR-2\", \"control_title\": \"Supply Chain Risk Management Plan Development\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

The risk management strategy is an important\nfactor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security\nand privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate\non the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program\npolicies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the\nneed for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part\nof the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the\ncomplex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy\nprograms, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe\nhow the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is\nthe object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans\nor in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control\npolicy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or\nchanges in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\nSimply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls: IA-1, PM-9, PM-24, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100], [IR 7874]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-1\", \"control_title\": \"Access Control Policy and Procedures Requirements\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Flow control restrictions include blocking external\ntraffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information\nfrom being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from\nthe internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based\non data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an\nagreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information\nbetween systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy\npolicies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy\npolicies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy\nenforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific\narchitectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes\nprohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only),\nverifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy\ndomain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-4\", \"control_title\": \"Information Flow Enforcement Based on Policies\", \"control_desc\": \"Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].

Enforce a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon\nattempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and\nb. Automatically [Selection (one or more): lock the account or node for an [Assignment:\norganization-defined time period]; lock the account or node until released by an\nadministrator; delay next logon prompt per [Assignment: organization-defined delay\nalgorithm]; notify system administrator; take other [Assignment: organization-defined\naction]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.\nDiscussion: The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent action when the\nmaximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a\nlocal or network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts\ninitiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,\norganization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ\ndifferent algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those\ncomponents. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating\nsystem and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the\nnumber of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to\nanswer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode\nwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying\nuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)\naddress. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in\nsupport of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to\nhelp prevent brute force attacks.

Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and\nimplementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and\nb.

Types of remote access\ninclude dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks\n(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted\nVPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such\nconnections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in\naccordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,\nand guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does\nnot enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect\nthe ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote\naccess controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public\naccess. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing\nremote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations\nmay use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote\naccess connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing\naccess restrictions for remote access is addressed via AC-3.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, CA-3, CM-10, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4, PE-\n17, PL-2, PL-4, SC-10, SC-12, SC-13, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) REMOTE ACCESS | MONITORING AND CONTROL\nEmploy automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods.\nDiscussion: Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to\ndetect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the\nconnection activities of remote users on a variety of system components, including servers,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-17\", \"control_title\": \"Remote Access Usage Restrictions and Authorization\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board\nsensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing\nlocal data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are\ntypically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability\nof the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems,\ndepending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile\ndevices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and\ncontrol such devices when outside of controlled areas.

Access the system from external systems; and\n2. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems;\nor\nb. Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external systems].\nDiscussion: External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems,\nand for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required\ncontrols or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned\nsystems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in\ncommercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;\nsystems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by,\noperated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems\nalso include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and\nsystems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the\noption to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of\nexternal systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned\nor prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships\nthat have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be\nsuch that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may\nnot be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing\ninformation exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations\nor components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders,\ndirectives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational\npersonnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and\nover which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding\nsystem access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be\nuniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.\nTherefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors\nthan on state, local, or tribal governments.\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope\nof AC-20. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in\naccordance with organizational security policies and procedures.

The types of events that require\nlogging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the\nprivacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event\ntypes include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or\nprivacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action\nchanges, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types\nthat require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of\nthe controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are\noperational and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging\nrequires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For\nexample, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access\nsuccessful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due\nto the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to\nbe logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help\nensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization.\nOrganizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals\nthat may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the\npotential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging\nevent is based on patterns or time of usage.\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in\nother controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1),\nCM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8),\nSI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records\ncan be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the\nnetwork. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring\nand auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types,\norganizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in\ndistributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented\narchitectures.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-\n11, AU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-\n7, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AU-2\", \"control_title\": \"Event Logging and Rationale for Selection\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Organizational users include employees or\nindividuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g.,\ncontractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to\nall accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the\nauthorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes\nexecute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of\nindividuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\nOrganizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user\nidentities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to\norganizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\naccess to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is\nobtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to\norganizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained\nthrough network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access\nthat involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area\nnetworks and wide area networks.\nThe use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-\ncontrolled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal\nnetworks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing\nthe network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are\ndescribed in IA-8.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, AU-1, AU-6, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8, MA-4, MA-\n5, PE-2, PL-4, SA-4, SA-8.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS\nImplement multi-factor authentication for access to privileged accounts.\nDiscussion: Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to\nachieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you\nknow (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical\nauthenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric).\nMulti-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware\nauthenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such\nas the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the Department of\nDefense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to authenticating users at the system\nlevel (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application\nlevel, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e.,\nlocal, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options\nappropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as\nadditional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.\nRelated Controls: AC-5, AC-6.\n(2) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"IA-2\", \"control_title\": \"Identification and Authentication of Organizational Users\", \"control_desc\": \"Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.

Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and\ndevelopment of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can\nbe obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring,\nand network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An\neffective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities\n(e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,\nphysical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function],\noperations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of\nsuspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain\nincidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational\nsystems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally\nidentifiable information is considered a breach. A breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the\nloss of control, unauthorized acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence where a person\nother than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable\ninformation or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such information for other\nthan authorized purposes.\nRelated Controls: AC-19, AU-6, AU-7, CM-6, CP-2, CP-3, CP-4, IR-2, IR-3, IR-5, IR-6, IR-8, PE-6, PL-\n2, PM-12, SA-8, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) INCIDENT HANDLING | AUTOMATED INCIDENT HANDLING PROCESSES\nSupport the incident handling process using [Assignment: organization-defined automated\nmechanisms].\nDiscussion: Automated mechanisms that support incident handling processes include online\nincident management systems and tools that support the collection of live response data,\nfull network packet capture, and forensic analysis.\nRelated Controls: None.\n(2) INCIDENT HANDLING | DYNAMIC RECONFIGURATION"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"IR-4\", \"control_title\": \"Incident Handling Capability and Coordination\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

The derived requirements include\nsecurity and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated\nwith such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,\nresistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements\ninclude development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from\ndevelopment and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required\nfunctionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [SP 800-160-1]\ndescribes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate\nfor achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting\nthe security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in\norder to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities.\nControls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection\nand implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in\nthe form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived\nrequirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of\nimplementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\nSecurity and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development\nlife cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and\noperation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security\ncategorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend\non the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements\ncan include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and\nservices. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in\nthe same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.\nRelated Controls: CM-6, CM-8, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-21, SR-3,\nSR-5.\nControl Enhancements:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SA-4\", \"control_title\": \"Acquisition Process Requirements and Assurance\", \"control_desc\": \"Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, using [Selection (one or more): standardized contract language; [Assignment: organization-defined contract language]] in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or system service: a.

External monitoring\nincludes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal\nmonitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations\nmonitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects\nsuch as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives\nguide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved\nthrough a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems,\nmalicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and\nnetwork monitoring software.\nDepending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices\nmay impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations\nacross a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput\nmanagement is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an\nestablished organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices\ninclude selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical\napplications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated\nwith controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational\nmonitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of\ntransactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP\nproxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and\nincident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those\nprograms. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system\nmonitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-\n13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-\n43b).

Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-\ndefined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental\nchanges; and\nc. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and\nmodification.\nDiscussion: The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well\nas the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an\norganization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized\nproduction, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software\nand hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply\nchain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an\norganization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted\nundertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships\nand communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management\n(SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response\nactions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance\nagainst plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy\nimplementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or\nincorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing,\nimplementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems\nacross the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are\ntailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans\nprovide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is\nfit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans\nhelp organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions\nbased on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk\nmanagement plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization,\nacceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently\nevaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating\nthe plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and\nassociated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address\nrequirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system\ncomponents and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented\nas part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).\nRelated Controls: CA-2, CP-4, IR-4, MA-2, MA-6, PE-16, PL-2, PM-9, PM-30, RA-3, RA-7, SA-8, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN | ESTABLISH SCRM TEAM"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SR-2\", \"control_title\": \"Supply Chain Risk Management Plan Development\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

The risk management strategy is an important\nfactor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security\nand privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate\non the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program\npolicies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the\nneed for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part\nof the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the\ncomplex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy\nprograms, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe\nhow the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is\nthe object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans\nor in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control\npolicy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or\nchanges in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\nSimply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls: IA-1, PM-9, PM-24, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100], [IR 7874]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-1\", \"control_title\": \"Access Control Policy and Procedures Requirements\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Flow control restrictions include blocking external\ntraffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information\nfrom being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from\nthe internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based\non data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an\nagreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information\nbetween systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy\npolicies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy\npolicies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy\nenforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific\narchitectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes\nprohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only),\nverifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy\ndomain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-4\", \"control_title\": \"Information Flow Enforcement Based on Policies\", \"control_desc\": \"Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].

Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts\ninitiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,\norganization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ\ndifferent algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those\ncomponents. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating\nsystem and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the\nnumber of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to\nanswer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode\nwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying\nuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)\naddress. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in\nsupport of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to\nhelp prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to\nrespond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is\nexceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not\npermitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-9, AU-2, AU-6, IA-5.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT LOCK\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-7.]\n(2) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | PURGE OR WIPE MOBILE DEVICE\nPurge or wipe information from [Assignment: organization-defined mobile devices] based\non [Assignment: organization-defined purging or wiping requirements and techniques]\nafter [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive, unsuccessful device logon\nattempts.\nDiscussion: A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it\ncan be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection;\npossesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained\npower source.

Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and\nimplementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and\nb.

Types of remote access\ninclude dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks\n(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted\nVPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such\nconnections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in\naccordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,\nand guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does\nnot enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect\nthe ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote\naccess controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public\naccess. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing\nremote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations\nmay use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote\naccess connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing\naccess restrictions for remote access is addressed via AC-3.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, CA-3, CM-10, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4, PE-\n17, PL-2, PL-4, SC-10, SC-12, SC-13, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) REMOTE ACCESS | MONITORING AND CONTROL\nEmploy automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods.\nDiscussion: Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to\ndetect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the\nconnection activities of remote users on a variety of system components, including servers,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-17\", \"control_title\": \"Remote Access Usage Restrictions and Authorization\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Organizations have the\noption to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of\nexternal systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned\nor prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).\nFor some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships\nthat have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be\nsuch that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may\nnot be considered external.

Authorized individuals include organizational\npersonnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and\nover which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding\nsystem access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be\nuniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.\nTherefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors\nthan on state, local, or tribal governments.\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope\nof AC-20.

Personnel are trained to look for\nindications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected email, receiving an\nemail containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an unfamiliar sender\nthat appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how\nto respond to suspicious email or web communications. For this process to work effectively,\npersonnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications.\nTraining personnel on how to recognize anomalous behaviors in systems can provide\norganizations with early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of\nanomalous behavior by organizational personnel can supplement malicious code detection\nand protection tools and systems employed by organizations.\nRelated Controls: None.\n(5) LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS | ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT\nProvide literacy training on the advanced persistent threat.\nDiscussion: An effective way to detect advanced persistent threats (APT) and to preclude\nsuccessful attacks is to provide specific literacy training for individuals. Threat literacy\ntraining includes educating individuals on the various ways that APTs can infiltrate the\norganization (e.g., through websites, emails, advertisement pop-ups, articles, and social"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AT-2\", \"control_title\": \"Security and Privacy Literacy Training Requirements\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit\nfunction: [Assignment: organization-defined event types that the system is capable of\nlogging];\nb. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-\nrelated information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;\nc.

Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined\nfrequency].\nDiscussion: An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require\nlogging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the\nprivacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event\ntypes include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or\nprivacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action\nchanges, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types\nthat require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of\nthe controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are\noperational and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging\nrequires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For\nexample, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access\nsuccessful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due\nto the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to\nbe logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help\nensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization.\nOrganizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals\nthat may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the\npotential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging\nevent is based on patterns or time of usage.\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in\nother controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1),\nCM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8),\nSI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records\ncan be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the\nnetwork. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring\nand auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types,\norganizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in\ndistributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented\narchitectures.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-\n11, AU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-\n7, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AU-2\", \"control_title\": \"Event Logging and Rationale for Selection\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Contingency planning\naddresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes\nwhen systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the\nsystem development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be\ndesigned for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans\nreflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need\nto fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery\nobjectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,\nguidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.\nActions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown,\nfallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for\nwhen systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling\nactivities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in\nthe event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an\nincident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4(5).\nIncident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in\nthe IR (Incident Response) family."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"CP-2\", \"control_title\": \"System Contingency Plan and Recovery Activities\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Organizational users include employees or\nindividuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g.,\ncontractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to\nall accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the\nauthorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes\nexecute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of\nindividuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\nOrganizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user\nidentities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to\norganizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\naccess to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is\nobtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to\norganizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained\nthrough network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access\nthat involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area\nnetworks and wide area networks.\nThe use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-\ncontrolled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal\nnetworks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing\nthe network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are\ndescribed in IA-8.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, AU-1, AU-6, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8, MA-4, MA-\n5, PE-2, PL-4, SA-4, SA-8.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS\nImplement multi-factor authentication for access to privileged accounts.\nDiscussion: Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to\nachieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you\nknow (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical\nauthenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric).\nMulti-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware\nauthenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such\nas the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the Department of\nDefense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to authenticating users at the system\nlevel (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application\nlevel, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e.,\nlocal, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options\nappropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as\nadditional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.\nRelated Controls: AC-5, AC-6.\n(2) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"IA-2\", \"control_title\": \"Identification and Authentication of Organizational Users\", \"control_desc\": \"Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.

Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and\ndevelopment of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can\nbe obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring,\nand network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An\neffective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities\n(e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,\nphysical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function],\noperations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of\nsuspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain\nincidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational\nsystems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally\nidentifiable information is considered a breach. A breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the\nloss of control, unauthorized acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence where a person\nother than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable\ninformation or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such information for other\nthan authorized purposes.\nRelated Controls: AC-19, AU-6, AU-7, CM-6, CP-2, CP-3, CP-4, IR-2, IR-3, IR-5, IR-6, IR-8, PE-6, PL-\n2, PM-12, SA-8, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) INCIDENT HANDLING | AUTOMATED INCIDENT HANDLING PROCESSES\nSupport the incident handling process using [Assignment: organization-defined automated\nmechanisms].\nDiscussion: Automated mechanisms that support incident handling processes include online\nincident management systems and tools that support the collection of live response data,\nfull network packet capture, and forensic analysis.\nRelated Controls: None.\n(2) INCIDENT HANDLING | DYNAMIC RECONFIGURATION"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"IR-4\", \"control_title\": \"Incident Handling Capability and Coordination\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Allocation of responsibility or identification of parties responsible for information security,\nprivacy, and supply chain risk management; and\ni. Acceptance criteria.\nDiscussion: Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-\nlevel security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements include\nsecurity and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated\nwith such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,\nresistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements\ninclude development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from\ndevelopment and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required\nfunctionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [SP 800-160-1]\ndescribes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate\nfor achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting\nthe security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in\norder to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities.\nControls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection\nand implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in\nthe form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived\nrequirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of\nimplementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\nSecurity and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development\nlife cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and\noperation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security\ncategorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend\non the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements\ncan include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and\nservices. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in\nthe same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.\nRelated Controls: CM-6, CM-8, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-21, SR-3,\nSR-5.\nControl Enhancements:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SA-4\", \"control_title\": \"Acquisition Process Requirements and Assurance\", \"control_desc\": \"Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, using [Selection (one or more): standardized contract language; [Assignment: organization-defined contract language]] in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or system service: a.

System monitoring capabilities are achieved\nthrough a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems,\nmalicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and\nnetwork monitoring software.\nDepending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices\nmay impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations\nacross a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput\nmanagement is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an\nestablished organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices\ninclude selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical\napplications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated\nwith controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational\nmonitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of\ntransactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP\nproxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and\nincident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those\nprograms. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system\nmonitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-\n13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-\n43b). Adjustments to levels of system monitoring are based on law enforcement information,\nintelligence information, or other sources of information.

Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-\ndefined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental\nchanges; and\nc. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and\nmodification.\nDiscussion: The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well\nas the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an\norganization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized\nproduction, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software\nand hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply\nchain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an\norganization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted\nundertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships\nand communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management\n(SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response\nactions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance\nagainst plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy\nimplementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or\nincorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing,\nimplementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems\nacross the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are\ntailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans\nprovide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is\nfit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans\nhelp organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions\nbased on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk\nmanagement plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization,\nacceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently\nevaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating\nthe plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and\nassociated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address\nrequirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system\ncomponents and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented\nas part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).\nRelated Controls: CA-2, CP-4, IR-4, MA-2, MA-6, PE-16, PL-2, PM-9, PM-30, RA-3, RA-7, SA-8, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN | ESTABLISH SCRM TEAM"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SR-2\", \"control_title\": \"Supply Chain Risk Management Plan Development\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

The rapid distribution\nand adoption of IOCs can improve information security by reducing the time that systems\nand organizations are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack. Threat indicators, signatures,\ntactics, techniques, procedures, and other indicators of compromise may be available via\ngovernment and non-government cooperatives, including the Forum of Incident Response\nand Security Teams, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, the Defense\nIndustrial Base Cybersecurity Information Sharing Program, and the CERT Coordination\nCenter.\nRelated Controls: AC-18.\n(25) SYSTEM MONITORING | OPTIMIZE NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS\nProvide visibility into network traffic at external and key internal system interfaces to\noptimize the effectiveness of monitoring devices.\nDiscussion: Encrypted traffic, asymmetric routing architectures, capacity and latency\nlimitations, and transitioning from older to newer technologies (e.g., IPv4 to IPv6 network\nprotocol transition) may result in blind spots for organizations when analyzing network\ntraffic.

Assign a risk designation to all organizational positions;\nb. Establish screening criteria for individuals filling those positions; and\nc. Review and update position risk designations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].\nDiscussion: Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management (OPM) policy and\nguidance. Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability\nand personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and\nresponsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or\nintegrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk\nlevel of that position. The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of\nthe position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse\neffect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the\nsensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation\nis conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations\nthat individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems.\nPosition screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements.\nParts 1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, establish the requirements for\norganizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk\ndesignation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions.\nRelated Controls: AC-5, AT-3, PE-2, PE-3, PL-2, PS-3, PS-6, SA-5, SA-21, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: [5 CFR 731], [SP 800-181].\nPS-3 PERSONNEL SCREENING\nControl:\na.

Develop and implement a plan for ongoing security and privacy control assessments;\nb. Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation\n[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] at [Assignment: organization-defined depth\nand coverage];\nc. Produce evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of the testing and\nevaluation;\nd. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and\ne. Correct flaws identified during testing and evaluation.\nDiscussion: Developmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required controls are\nimplemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security and privacy\npolicies, and meeting established security and privacy requirements. Security properties of\nsystems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection of system\ncomponents or changes to those components. The interconnections or changes—including\nupgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware—may adversely affect\npreviously implemented controls. Ongoing assessment during development allows for additional\ntypes of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential\nflaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as manual code\nreview, security architecture review, and penetration testing, as well as and static analysis,\ndynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches.\nDevelopers can use the analysis approaches, along with security instrumentation and fuzzing, in a\nvariety of tools and in source code reviews. The security and privacy assessment plans include\nthe specific activities that developers plan to carry out, including the types of analyses, testing,\nevaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components; the degree of rigor to be applied;\nthe frequency of the ongoing testing and evaluation; and the types of artifacts produced during\nthose processes. The depth of testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail\nassociated with the assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the\nscope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts\nspecify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment plans, flaw remediation\nprocesses, and the evidence that the plans and processes have been diligently applied. Methods\nfor reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate\nwith the security category or classification level of the system.

Organizations can apply\nsystems security and privacy engineering principles to new systems under development or to\nsystems undergoing upgrades. For existing systems, organizations apply systems security and\nprivacy engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given\nthe current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems.\nThe application of systems security and privacy engineering principles helps organizations\ndevelop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduces the susceptibility to disruptions,\nhazards, threats, and the creation of privacy problems for individuals. Examples of system\nsecurity engineering principles include: developing layered protections; establishing security and\nprivacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development;\nincorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle;\ndelineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how\nto build secure software; tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; and performing threat\nmodeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and\ncompensating controls needed to mitigate risk.\nOrganizations that apply systems security and privacy engineering concepts and principles can\nfacilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system\nservices; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions. System\nsecurity engineering principles can also be used to protect against certain supply chain risks,\nincluding incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into a design.\nRelated Controls: PL-8, PM-7, RA-2, RA-3, RA-9, SA-3, SA-4, SA-15, SA-17, SA-20, SC-2, SC-3, SC-\n32, SC-39, SR-2, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | CLEAR ABSTRACTIONS\nImplement the security design principle of clear abstractions.\nDiscussion: The principle of clear abstractions states that a system has simple, well-defined\ninterfaces and functions that provide a consistent and intuitive view of the data and how the\ndata is managed.

The risk management strategy is an\nimportant factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute\nto security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs\ncollaborate on the development of media protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy\nprogram policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may\nobviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be\nincluded as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies\nthat reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and\nprivacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures\ndescribe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or\nrole that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and\nprivacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to\nmedia protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents\nor breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,\nstandards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy\nor procedure.\nRelated Controls: PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}]}

Organizations also consider any\ndemographic or contextual factors that may influence the understanding or behavior of\nindividuals with respect to the processing carried out by the system or organization. When\nsoliciting consent from individuals, organizations consider the appropriate mechanism for\nobtaining consent, including the type of consent (e.g., opt-in, opt-out), how to properly\nauthenticate and identity proof individuals and how to obtain consent through electronic means.\nIn addition, organizations consider providing a mechanism for individuals to revoke consent once\nit has been provided, as appropriate.

Review and update the current physical and environmental protection:\n1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment:\norganization-defined events]; and\n2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment:\norganization-defined events].\nDiscussion: Physical and environmental protection policy and procedures address the controls in\nthe PE family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management\nstrategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and\nprocedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security\nand privacy programs collaborate on the development of physical and environmental protection\npolicy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization\nlevel are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies\nand procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or\nbe represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures\ncan be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for\nsystems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can\nbe directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be\ndocumented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events\nthat may precipitate an update to physical and environmental protection policy and procedures\ninclude assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply\nrestating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls: AT-3, PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}]}

Formal methods can be used to show that the high-\nlevel security properties are satisfied by the formal system description, and that the formal\nsystem description is correctly implemented by a description of some lower level, including a\nhardware description. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the formal\npolicy models is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a combination of\nformal and informal methods may be needed to demonstrate such consistency. Consistency\nbetween the formal top-level specification and the actual implementation may require the\nuse of an informal demonstration due to limitations on the applicability of formal methods\nto prove that the specification accurately reflects the implementation.

Consistency between the descriptive top-level specification (i.e., high-\nlevel/low-level design) and the formal policy model is generally not amenable to being fully\nproven. Therefore, a combination of formal and informal methods may be needed to show\nsuch consistency.

The principle of\nsecure metadata management is driven by the recognition that a system, subsystem, or\ncomponent cannot achieve self-protection unless it protects the data it relies on for correct\nexecution. Data is generally not interpreted by the system that stores it. It may have\nsemantic value (i.e., it comprises information) to users and programs that process the data.\nIn contrast, metadata is information about data, such as a file name or the date when the\nfile was created. Metadata is bound to the target data that it describes in a way that the\nsystem can interpret, but it need not be stored inside of or proximate to its target data.\nThere may be metadata whose target is itself metadata (e.g., the classification level or\nimpact level of a file name), including self-referential metadata.\nThe apparent secondary nature of metadata can lead to neglect of its legitimate need for\nprotection, resulting in a violation of the security policy that includes the exfiltration of\ninformation. A particular concern associated with insufficient protections for metadata is\nassociated with multilevel secure (MLS) systems. MLS systems mediate access by a subject to\nan object based on relative sensitivity levels. It follows that all subjects and objects in the\nscope of control of the MLS system are either directly labeled or indirectly attributed with\nsensitivity levels. The corollary of labeled metadata for MLS systems states that objects\ncontaining metadata are labeled. As with protection needs assessments for data, attention is\ngiven to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity protections are individually assessed,\nspecified, and allocated to metadata, as would be done for mission, business, and system\ndata.\nRelated Controls: None.\n(21) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | SELF-ANALYSIS\nImplement the security design principle of self-analysis in [Assignment: organization-\ndefined systems or system components].\nDiscussion: The principle of self-analysis states that a system component is able to assess its\ninternal state and functionality to a limited extent at various stages of execution, and that\nthis self-analysis capability is commensurate with the level of trustworthiness invested in the\nsystem. At the system level, self-analysis can be achieved through hierarchical assessments\nof trustworthiness established in a bottom-up fashion. In this approach, the lower-level\ncomponents check for data integrity and correct functionality (to a limited extent) of higher-\nlevel components. For example, trusted boot sequences involve a trusted lower-level\ncomponent that attests to the trustworthiness of the next higher-level components so that a\ntransitive chain of trust can be established. At the root, a component attests to itself, which\nusually involves an axiomatic or environmentally enforced assumption about its integrity.\nResults of the self-analyses can be used to guard against externally induced errors, internal\nmalfunction, or transient errors. By following this principle, some simple malfunctions or\nerrors can be detected without allowing the effects of the error or malfunction to propagate\noutside of the component. Further, the self-test can be used to attest to the configuration of\nthe component, detecting any potential conflicts in configuration with respect to the\nexpected configuration.\nRelated Controls: CA-7.\n(22) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES | ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRACEABILITY"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}]}
