The risk management strategy is an important\nfactor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security\nand privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate\non the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program\npolicies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the\nneed for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part\nof the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the\ncomplex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy\nprograms, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe\nhow the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is\nthe object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans\nor in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control\npolicy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or\nchanges in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\nSimply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.\nRelated Controls: IA-1, PM-9, PM-24, PS-8, SI-12.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: [OMB A-130], [SP 800-12], [SP 800-30], [SP 800-39], [SP 800-100], [IR 7874]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-1\", \"control_title\": \"Access Control Policy and Procedures Requirements\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Flow control restrictions include blocking external\ntraffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information\nfrom being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from\nthe internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based\non data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an\nagreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information\nbetween systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy\npolicies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy\npolicies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy\nenforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific\narchitectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes\nprohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only),\nverifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy\ndomain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-4\", \"control_title\": \"Information Flow Enforcement Based on Policies\", \"control_desc\": \"Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].

Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts\ninitiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,\norganization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ\ndifferent algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those\ncomponents. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating\nsystem and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the\nnumber of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to\nanswer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode\nwith limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying\nuser profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC)\naddress. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in\nsupport of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to\nhelp prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to\nrespond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is\nexceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not\npermitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-9, AU-2, AU-6, IA-5.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | AUTOMATIC ACCOUNT LOCK\n[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-7.]\n(2) UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS | PURGE OR WIPE MOBILE DEVICE\nPurge or wipe information from [Assignment: organization-defined mobile devices] based\non [Assignment: organization-defined purging or wiping requirements and techniques]\nafter [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive, unsuccessful device logon\nattempts.\nDiscussion: A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it\ncan be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection;\npossesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained\npower source.

Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and\nimplementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and\nb.

Types of remote access\ninclude dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks\n(VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted\nVPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such\nconnections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in\naccordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,\nand guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does\nnot enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect\nthe ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote\naccess controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public\naccess. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing\nremote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations\nmay use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote\naccess connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing\naccess restrictions for remote access is addressed via AC-3.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, CA-3, CM-10, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4, PE-\n17, PL-2, PL-4, SC-10, SC-12, SC-13, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) REMOTE ACCESS | MONITORING AND CONTROL\nEmploy automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods.\nDiscussion: Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to\ndetect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the\nconnection activities of remote users on a variety of system components, including servers,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AC-17\", \"control_title\": \"Remote Access Usage Restrictions and Authorization\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Authorized individuals include organizational\npersonnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and\nover which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding\nsystem access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be\nuniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations.\nTherefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors\nthan on state, local, or tribal governments.\nExternal systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope\nof AC-20.

Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit\nfunction: [Assignment: organization-defined event types that the system is capable of\nlogging];\nb. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-\nrelated information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;\nc.

Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined\nfrequency].\nDiscussion: An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require\nlogging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the\nprivacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event\ntypes include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or\nprivacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action\nchanges, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types\nthat require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of\nthe controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are\noperational and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging\nrequires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For\nexample, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access\nsuccessful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due\nto the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to\nbe logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help\nensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization.\nOrganizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals\nthat may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the\npotential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging\nevent is based on patterns or time of usage.\nEvent logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in\nother controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1),\nCM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3.b), MA-4(1), MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8),\nSI-4(22), SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable\nlaws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records\ncan be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the\nnetwork. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring\nand auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types,\norganizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in\ndistributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented\narchitectures.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-16, AC-17, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-\n11, AU-12, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-13, IA-3, MA-4, MP-4, PE-3, PM-21, PT-2, PT-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-\n7, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, SI-10, SI-11."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"AU-2\", \"control_title\": \"Event Logging and Rationale for Selection\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Contingency planning\naddresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes\nwhen systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the\nsystem development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be\ndesigned for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans\nreflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need\nto fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery\nobjectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,\nguidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.\nActions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown,\nfallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for\nwhen systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling\nactivities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in\nthe event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an\nincident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4(5).\nIncident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in\nthe IR (Incident Response) family."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"CP-2\", \"control_title\": \"System Contingency Plan and Recovery Activities\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Organizational users include employees or\nindividuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g.,\ncontractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to\nall accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the\nauthorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes\nexecute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of\nindividuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\nOrganizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user\nidentities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to\norganizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\naccess to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is\nobtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to\norganizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained\nthrough network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access\nthat involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area\nnetworks and wide area networks.\nThe use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-\ncontrolled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal\nnetworks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing\nthe network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are\ndescribed in IA-8.\nRelated Controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, AU-1, AU-6, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8, MA-4, MA-\n5, PE-2, PL-4, SA-4, SA-8.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS\nImplement multi-factor authentication for access to privileged accounts.\nDiscussion: Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to\nachieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you\nknow (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical\nauthenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric).\nMulti-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware\nauthenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such\nas the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the Department of\nDefense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to authenticating users at the system\nlevel (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application\nlevel, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e.,\nlocal, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options\nappropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as\nadditional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.\nRelated Controls: AC-5, AC-6.\n(2) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | MULTI-FACTOR\nAUTHENTICATION TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"IA-2\", \"control_title\": \"Identification and Authentication of Organizational Users\", \"control_desc\": \"Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.

Organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and\ndevelopment of mission and business processes and systems. Incident-related information can\nbe obtained from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access monitoring,\nand network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and reported supply chain events. An\neffective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities\n(e.g., mission or business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices,\nphysical security offices, personnel security offices, legal departments, risk executive [function],\noperations personnel, procurement offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of\nsuspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain\nincidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational\nsystems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally\nidentifiable information is considered a breach.

Allocation of responsibility or identification of parties responsible for information security,\nprivacy, and supply chain risk management; and\ni. Acceptance criteria.\nDiscussion: Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-\nlevel security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements include\nsecurity and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated\nwith such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,\nresistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements\ninclude development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from\ndevelopment and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required\nfunctionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. [SP 800-160-1]\ndescribes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate\nfor achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting\nthe security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in\norder to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities.\nControls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection\nand implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in\nthe form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived\nrequirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of\nimplementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\nSecurity and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development\nlife cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and\noperation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security\ncategorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend\non the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements\ncan include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and\nservices. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in\nthe same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.\nRelated Controls: CM-6, CM-8, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-21, SR-3,\nSR-5.\nControl Enhancements:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SA-4\", \"control_title\": \"Acquisition Process Requirements and Assurance\", \"control_desc\": \"Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, using [Selection (one or more): standardized contract language; [Assignment: organization-defined contract language]] in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or system service: a.

External monitoring\nincludes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal\nmonitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations\nmonitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects\nsuch as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives\nguide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved\nthrough a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems,\nmalicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and\nnetwork monitoring software.\nDepending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices\nmay impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations\nacross a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput\nmanagement is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an\nestablished organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices\ninclude selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical\napplications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated\nwith controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational\nmonitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of\ntransactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP\nproxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and\nincident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those\nprograms. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system\nmonitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-\n13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-\n43b). Adjustments to levels of system monitoring are based on law enforcement information,\nintelligence information, or other sources of information. The legality of system monitoring\nactivities is based on applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,\nstandards, and guidelines."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SI-4\", \"control_title\": \"System Monitoring to Detect Potential Attacks\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research and\ndevelopment, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and\nmaintenance, and disposal of the following systems, system components or system services:\n[Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services];\nb. Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-\ndefined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental\nchanges; and\nc. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and\nmodification.\nDiscussion: The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well\nas the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an\norganization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized\nproduction, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software\nand hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply\nchain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an\norganization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted\nundertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships\nand communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management\n(SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response\nactions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance\nagainst plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy\nimplementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or\nincorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing,\nimplementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems\nacross the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are\ntailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans\nprovide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is\nfit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans\nhelp organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions\nbased on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk\nmanagement plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization,\nacceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently\nevaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating\nthe plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and\nassociated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address\nrequirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system\ncomponents and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented\nas part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).\nRelated Controls: CA-2, CP-4, IR-4, MA-2, MA-6, PE-16, PL-2, PM-9, PM-30, RA-3, RA-7, SA-8, SI-4.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN | ESTABLISH SCRM TEAM"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[{\"control_id\": \"SR-2\", \"control_title\": \"Supply Chain Risk Management Plan Development\", \"control_desc\": \"a.

Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information\nare not prevented from passing the information to other subjects or objects (i.e., subjects\nhave the discretion to pass). Discretionary access control can operate in conjunction with\nmandatory access control as described in AC-3(3) and AC-3(15). A subject that is constrained\nin its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under the less rigorous\nconstraints of discretionary access control. Therefore, while AC-3(3) imposes constraints that\nprevent a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different\nimpact or classification level, AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any\nsubject at the same impact or classification level. The policy is bounded by the system. Once\nthe information is passed outside of system control, additional means may be required to\nensure that the constraints remain in effect.

Security-relevant information includes access control lists,\nfiltering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, and\ncryptographic key management information.

When users are assigned to specific roles, they inherit the authorizations or\nprivileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations\nbecause privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a large number of\nindividuals) but are instead acquired through role assignments.

Review and revise the mission and business processes [Assignment: organization-defined\nfrequency].\nDiscussion: Protection needs are technology-independent capabilities that are required to\ncounter threats to organizations, individuals, systems, and the Nation through the compromise\nof information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability, or privacy). Information\nprotection and personally identifiable information processing needs are derived from the mission\nand business needs defined by organizational stakeholders, the mission and business processes\ndesigned to meet those needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information\nprotection and personally identifiable information processing needs determine the required\ncontrols for the organization and the systems. Inherent to defining protection and personally\nidentifiable information processing needs is an understanding of the adverse impact that could\nresult if a compromise or breach of information occurs. The categorization process is used to\nmake such potential impact determinations. Privacy risks to individuals can arise from the\ncompromise of personally identifiable information, but they can also arise as unintended\nconsequences or a byproduct of the processing of personally identifiable information at any\nstage of the information life cycle. Privacy risk assessments are used to prioritize the risks that\nare created for individuals from system processing of personally identifiable information. These\nrisk assessments enable the selection of the required privacy controls for the organization and\nsystems. Mission and business process definitions and the associated protection requirements\nare documented in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.\nRelated Controls: CP-2, PL-2, PM-7, PM-8, RA-2, RA-3, RA-9, SA-2.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: [OMB A-130], [FIPS 199],[SP 800-39], [SP 800-60-1], [SP 800-60-2], [SP 800-160-1].\nPM-12 INSIDER THREAT PROGRAM\nControl: Implement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat\nincident handling team.\nDiscussion: Organizations that handle classified information are required, under Executive Order\n13587 [EO 13587] and the National Insider Threat Policy [ODNI NITP], to establish insider threat\nprograms. The same standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified\nenvironments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified\nand other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include controls\nto detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis\nof both technical and nontechnical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A\nsenior official is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual to\nimplement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and\nanalysis capability, insider threat programs require organizations to prepare department or\nagency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of\nindividual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat\nawareness training to employees, receive access to information from offices in the department\nor agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department or agency\ninsider threat posture.\nInsider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations\nmay already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources\nrecords are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some\ntypes of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace, including\nongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues.\nThese precursors can guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts.\nHowever, the use of human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy.

As part of initial training for new users and [Assignment: organization-defined\nfrequency] thereafter; and\n2. When required by system changes or following [Assignment: organization-defined\nevents];\nb.

Update literacy training and awareness content [Assignment: organization-defined\nfrequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and\nd. Incorporate lessons learned from internal or external security incidents or breaches into\nliteracy training and awareness techniques.\nDiscussion: Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of literacy training to system users,\nincluding measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of\nliteracy training and awareness based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to\nwhich personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content\nincludes an understanding of the need for security and privacy as well as actions by users to\nmaintain security and personal privacy and to respond to suspected incidents. The content\naddresses the need for operations security and the handling of personally identifiable\ninformation.\nAwareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security and\nprivacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from\norganizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Literacy training after the initial\ntraining described in AT-2a.1 is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable\nlaws, directives, regulations, and policies.

The placement of controls in systems and organizations is an important\nactivity that requires thoughtful analysis.

For example,\nvendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at different times,\noften developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms based on their priorities\nand development schedules. By deploying different products at different locations, there is\nan increased likelihood that at least one of the products will detect the malicious code.

This includes planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing,\nand monitoring the organization-defined, centrally managed controls and processes. As the\ncentral management of controls is generally associated with the concept of common (inherited)\ncontrols, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of control implementations\nand management and the judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally managed controls\nand processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial\nand ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring.\nAutomated tools (e.g., security information and event management tools or enterprise security\nmonitoring and management tools) can improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of\ninformation associated with centrally managed controls and processes. Automation can also\nprovide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities; alerting mechanisms; and dashboards\nto support risk-based decision-making within the organization.\nAs part of the control selection processes, organizations determine the controls that may be\nsuitable for central management based on resources and capabilities. It is not always possible to\ncentrally manage every aspect of a control. In such cases, the control can be treated as a hybrid\ncontrol with the control managed and implemented centrally or at the system level. The controls\nand control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management include but\nare not limited to: AC-2(1), AC-2(2), AC-2(3), AC-2(4), AC-4(all), AC-17(1), AC-17(2), AC-17(3), AC-\n17(9), AC-18(1), AC-18(3), AC-18(4), AC-18(5), AC-19(4), AC-22, AC-23, AT-2(1), AT-2(2), AT-3(1),\nAT-3(2), AT-3(3), AT-4, AU-3, AU-6(1), AU-6(3), AU-6(5), AU-6(6), AU-6(9), AU-7(1), AU-7(2), AU-\n11, AU-13, AU-16, CA-2(1), CA-2(2), CA-2(3), CA-3(1), CA-3(2), CA-3(3), CA-7(1), CA-9, CM-2(2),\nCM-3(1), CM-3(4), CM-4, CM-6, CM-6(1), CM-7(2), CM-7(4), CM-7(5), CM-8(all), CM-9(1), CM-10,\nCM-11, CP-7(all), CP-8(all), SC-43, SI-2, SI-3, SI-4(all), SI-7, SI-8."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}]}

Organizations consider rules of behavior\nbased on individual user roles and responsibilities and differentiate between rules that apply to\nprivileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of behavior for some\ntypes of non-organizational users, including individuals who receive information from federal\nsystems, is often not feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their\ninteractions with the systems. Rules of behavior for organizational and non-organizational users\ncan also be established in AC-8.

Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal\nCommunications Commission (FCC) program that directs telecommunications service\nproviders (e.g., wireline and wireless phone companies) to give preferential treatment to\nusers enrolled in the program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored\nfollowing a disruption of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and policies\nfor the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages the TSP program.\nThe TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a major disaster or attack taking\nplace. Federal sponsorship is required to enroll in the TSP program.\nRelated Controls: None.\n(2) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES | SINGLE POINTS OF FAILURE\nObtain alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single\npoint of failure with primary telecommunications services.\nDiscussion: In certain circumstances, telecommunications service providers or services may\nshare the same physical lines, which increases the vulnerability of a single failure point. It is\nimportant to have provider transparency for the actual physical transmission capability for\ntelecommunication services."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}]}

Malicious code can also be\nencoded in various formats contained within compressed or hidden files or hidden in files using\ntechniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of\nways, including by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and portable storage devices. Malicious\ncode insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies\nand methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code.\nMalicious code protection mechanisms include both signature- and nonsignature-based\ntechnologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence\ntechniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of\nmalicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or\nfor which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do\nnot yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes\nsignatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based\ntechnologies. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management,\ncomprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in\npreventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial\noff-the-shelf software as well as custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors,\nand other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.\nIn situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies,\norganizations rely on other types of controls, including secure coding practices, configuration\nmanagement and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to ensure\nthat software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may\ndetermine that, in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be\nwarranted.

DO NOT extract:\n   - Control IDs listed under:\n     - \"Related controls\"\n     - \"Referenced controls\"\n     - \"See also\"\n     - \"Cross references\"\n     - Tables of contents\n     - Indexes\n     - Questionnaires or audit questions\n   - Section headings, titles, or topic labels without enforceable requirements\n   - Controls marked as \"withdrawn\", \"deprecated\", \"not applicable\", or \"informative\"\n   - Any inferred or implied control not explicitly defined in the text\n\n3. If the page does NOT clearly define a control, output an empty list: []\n\n========================\nCONTROL ID DETECTION\n========================\n\nRecognize ONLY these Control ID patterns:\n\n- ISO / Annex A:\n  - A.5.1\n  - A.8.12\n  - A.12.1.1\n\n- NIST:\n  - AC-1\n  - IA-5\n  - PM-10\n\n- Legislative / Regulatory:\n  - Sec. 302\n  - Section 404\n\nDO NOT treat IDs appearing inside explanatory text, examples, or references as controls.\n\n========================\nCONTROL BOUNDARY LOGIC\n========================\n\n- A valid control's description MUST:\n  - Immediately follow or be clearly scoped to the Control ID\n  - Contain enforceable language (e.g., \"shall\", \"must\", \"is required to\")\n- STOP the description when:\n  - A new Control ID appears\n  - A new section or heading begins\n  - The text shifts to references, examples, or guidance\n\n========================\nOUTPUT RULES (STRICT)\n========================\n\n- Output ONLY a raw JSON array\n- No markdown\n- No explanations\n- No extra text\n- No hallucinations\n\nEach object MUST have:\n\n{\n  \"control_id\": \"<exact identifier>\",\n  \"control_title\": \"<concise title from text, 5–10 words>\",\n  \"control_desc\": \"<full enforceable requirement text>\"\n}\n\n========================\nFAIL-SAFE BEHAVIOR\n========================\n\n- If uncertain whether text defines a real control → SKIP IT\n- If zero valid controls exist → output []\n\n========================\nREMEMBER\n========================\n\nHigh precision > high recall.\nIt is better to return [] than an incorrect control."}, {"role": "user", "content": "NIST SP 800-53, REV. 5     SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONTROLS FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nCHAPTER THREE                                           PAGE 46\nThis\npublication\nis\navailable\nfree\nof\ncharge\nfrom:\nRelated Controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-21, AC-25, AU-2, AU-10, MP-3, PE-22, PT-2, PT-3, PT-4,\nSC-11, SC-16, SI-12, SI-18.\nControl Enhancements:\n(1) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES | DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION\nDynamically associate security and privacy attributes with [Assignment: organization-\ndefined subjects and objects] in accordance with the following security and privacy policies\nas information is created and combined: [Assignment: organization-defined security and\nprivacy policies].\nDiscussion: Dynamic association of attributes is appropriate whenever the security or\nprivacy characteristics of information change over time. Attributes may change due to\ninformation aggregation issues (i.e., characteristics of individual data elements are different\nfrom the combined elements), changes in individual access authorizations (i.e., privileges),\nchanges in the security category of information, or changes in security or privacy policies.\nAttributes may also change situationally.\nRelated Controls: None.\n(2) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE VALUE CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS\nProvide authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals) the capability\nto define or change the value of associated security and privacy attributes.\nDiscussion: The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of\nindividuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for systems to be\nable to limit the ability to create or modify attributes to authorized individuals.\nRelated Controls: None.\n(3) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES | MAINTENANCE OF ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATIONS BY SYSTEM\nMaintain the association and integrity of [Assignment: organization-defined security and\nprivacy attributes] to [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects].\nDiscussion: Maintaining the association and integrity of security and privacy attributes to\nsubjects and objects with sufficient assurance helps to ensure that the attribute associations\ncan be used as the basis of automated policy actions. The integrity of specific items, such as\nsecurity configuration files, may be maintained through the use of an integrity monitoring\nmechanism that detects anomalies and changes that deviate from “known good” baselines.\nAutomated policy actions include retention date expirations, access control decisions,\ninformation flow control decisions, and information disclosure decisions.\nRelated Controls: None.\n(4) SECURITY AND PRIVACY ATTRIBUTES | ASSOCIATION OF ATTRIBUTES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS\nProvide the capability to associate [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy\nattributes] with [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects] by authorized\nindividuals (or processes acting on behalf of individuals).\nDiscussion: Systems, in general, provide the capability for privileged users to assign security\nand privacy attributes to system-defined subjects (e.g., users) and objects (e.g., directories,\nfiles, and ports). Some systems provide additional capability for general users to assign\nsecurity and privacy attributes to additional objects (e.g., files, emails). The association of\nattributes by authorized individuals is described in the design documentation. The support\nprovided by systems can include prompting users to select security and privacy attributes to\nbe associated with information objects, employing automated mechanisms to categorize\ninformation with attributes based on defined policies, or ensuring that the combination of\nthe security or privacy attributes selected is valid. Organizations consider the creation,\ndeletion, or modification of attributes when defining auditable events."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[]"}]}
