This includes requirements from internal sources (e.g., the organization\u2019s policies, business objectives, and risk management strategy) and external sources (e.g., applicable laws and regulations).",
    "Deployment_points": "1. Establish a centralized repository for security requirements to ensure accessibility and minimize duplication of effort. 2. Regularly review and update security requirements based on internal policies, business objectives, and external regulations, at least annually or after significant incidents. 3. Communicate security requirements to all stakeholders involved in the SDLC to ensure they are integrated into the development process. 4. Train relevant personnel on the importance of security requirements and how to apply them throughout the SDLC. 5. Implement a feedback mechanism to capture changes in requirements from both internal and external sources."
